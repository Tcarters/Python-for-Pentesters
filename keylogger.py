#If the “keyboard” module is not available on your system, we can use pip3 to install it.
#pip3 install keyboard   

#Using the keyboard module, the following three lines of code would be enough to record and replay keys pressed: 
#“keyboard.record” will record the keys until ENTER is pressed, and “keyboard.play” will replay them. As this script is logging keystrokes, any edit using backspace will also be seen. 
import keyboard
keys = keyboard.record(until ='ENTER')
keyboard.play(keys)
